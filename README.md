# Used_Car_Auction_Price_Prediction

Predicting the price of used cars in both an important and interesting 
problem. In many developed countries, it is common to lease a car rather than 
buying it outright. A lease is a binding contract between a buyer and a seller.
Predicting the selling price of a car is not a simple task. It is trite knowledge 
that the value of used cars depends on a number of parameter. The most important 
ones are usually the odometer, its condition, make (and model), colour, interior, 
body, transmission etc.
As we can see, the price depends on a large number of parameters. 
Unfortunately, information about all these parameters are not always available and 
the buyer must make the decision to purchase at a certain price based on few 
factors only.
In this project we are predicting how does each parameter affects on the 
value of selling price
